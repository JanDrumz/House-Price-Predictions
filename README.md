In the next five years, the US housing market is predicted to experience a slowdown, with prices either flat or experiencing a modest decline. According to a report by Zillow, home values are projected to increase by 5.5% over the next year, slower than the 16.9% increase seen in 2021.

Ready to shop for homes, but overwhelmed by the types of houses or listing descriptions or unsure which type of home is right for you? Dwellings can be classified in two ways, either by the types of homes or styles of homes. The home type refers to the building structure, while the house style is based on the architectural elements that make up its design.

Knowing the different types of houses and styles available can help you make an informed decision when you buy your next home. It can also help you better understand your current residence.
